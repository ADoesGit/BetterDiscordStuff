# AccountSwitcher
AccountSwitcher is an unofficial plugin that is not supported by the BetterDiscord moderators. This is why AccountSwitcher is not allowed to be in this repository anymore.

## Moved
This plugin got moved [here](https://github.com/l0c4lh057/AccountSwitcher). Use it on your own risk.

### Do **NOT** ask in the BetterDiscord servers about this plugin!

This plugin does not contain any malicious code, but it is not accepted by BetterDiscord moderators. They don't want a useful plugin, just because someone could abuse it for something bad and it would save malicious people half an hour of work.

## Why?
I don't really know. But this is what they wrote.

And again they are talkin about the `token stealing` incident, even though I don't see any connection between AccountSwitcher and token stealing. AccountSwitcher does not give anyone the possibility to steal tokens and every plugin could steal tokens. The only reason why they say this is because this plugin uses tokens. It does absolutely nothing malicious with tokens, but it uses tokens.
It seems like using tokens is the same as stealing tokens for BetterDiscord mods.
